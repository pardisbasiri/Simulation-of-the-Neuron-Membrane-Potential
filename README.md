# Simulation-of-the-Neuron-Membrane-Potential
Simulation of the membrane potential of a neuron in response to an external stimulation, employing ion channel dynamics and the Euler method.

This simulation is based on a simplified model of a neuron's electrical behavior, where the neuron's membrane potential is influenced by the flow of ions, specifically sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+), as well as an external stimulation. 

The simulation starts with an initial resting membrane potential of -70 mV and runs for a duration of 50 milliseconds. During this simulation, an external electrical stimulation is applied to the neuron's membrane potential between 10 ms and 20 ms, with an amplitude of 20 mV. The neuron's membrane potential is updated at each time step using the Euler method, taking into account the flow of ions through sodium and potassium channels. The resulting membrane potential changes are plotted over time, showing how the neuron's potential responds to the applied stimulation and ion channel dynamics.
